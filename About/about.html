                              companies, and the pioneering people who made them great.

                    <p>For generations Transocean and its legacy companies have led the offshore drilling industry with the most
                        innovative and sophisticated technology, and the people that put it to record-setting use. From the first mobile jackup rig and the first
                        drillship, both in the 1950s, to the 2016  drillships that incorporate our designed and patented Active Power Compensation® hybrid system, we're are still pushing the curve.

                    <h2>1920s</h2>
                     <p>Transocean traces its roots to onshore drilling operations, where T.S. "Stoney" Stoneman began his career as a draftsman and then a landman before joining the Danciger Oil & Refining Company of Fort Worth, Texas in 1926.</p><br>
                       <p> Mr. Stoneman bought the company's first drilling rig, paying for it with a personal check and putting it on his expense report. He would later play key leadership roles in pioneering offshore drilling with The Offshore Company.

                    <h2>1930s</h2>
                    <p>While the first tentative steps to developing the marine drilling industry were being taken in the 1930s, drilling engineers were advancing onshore drilling methods and equipment.</p><br>
                    <p>While Danciger's T.S. Stoneman, shown in the photo above, continued his successful land career in the United States, Raymond Godet, an engineer who would later be a leader in another legacy company, Forex, was busy in France. Mr. Godet bought a German drilling rig in Paris and hooked it up to a boiler from a steam engine, enabling the rig to drill land wells at Saint Marcet.

                    <h2>1940s</h2>
                    <p>Several legacy Transocean entities emerged in the 1940s when the following companies were formed. </p><br>
                 <ul>
                    <li><p>1942 - Forex was established in France </p></li>
                 <li><p>1946</p></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Santa Fe Drilling Company was established. Joe Robinson, a Union Oil Company drilling superintendent, and 61 drilling department employees put up $250,000 of their own money and borrowed $600,000 to buy the business from Union Oil. Santa Fe began drilling wells onshore in California in 1947. In less than two years, the loan was paid in full.</p></li><br>
                   <li><p>The CUSS group was formed. This consortium of Continental Oil Company, Union Oil Company of California, Superior Oil Company and Shell Oil Company established the feasibility of drilling offshore. The CUSS group later evolved into Global Marine. 
                    </p></li> 
                </ul>  

                  <li><p>1947 - Southeastern Drilling Company (Sedco) began operations. Led by Bill Clements, who would one day become a two-term Texas governor, Sedco began operations with two diesel-powered land rigs.</p></li> 
                </ul>

                    <h2>1950s</h2>
                    <p>An important decade of innovation including the introduction of the world's first mobile jackup drilling rig and the first drillship ushered in new operations.</p><br>

                    <ul>

                        <li><p>1950 - Southern Production Co., a subsidiary of Southern National Gas, purchased Danciger and later began work to form The Offshore Company.</p></li><br>
                        <li><p>1953 - The Offshore Company was created to design and build Rig 51 (shown in photo), the world's first mobile jackup drilling rig.</p></li><br>
                        <li><p>1954 - The Offshore Company launched Rig 51. A new pneumatic jacking system raised the unit's legs at one drilling location so that the rig could be moved to the next where the legs were lowered to the seafloor. At that point, the rig's deck was elevated above the sea surface.</p></li><br>
                        <li><p>1955 - Sedco began operations with two, shallow-water semisubmersible barges in South Texas and built Rig 21, the first "post-type" swamp barge.</p></li><br>
                        <li><p>1956</p></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>Global Marine Drilling Company commissioned the CUSS I, the first drillship. This rig pioneered early versions of deepwater drilling methods and technology used by today’s offshore drilling fleet.</p></li><br>
                            <li><p>Santa Fe entered the offshore drilling business with a contract in Trinidad using a land rig adapted to a jackup barge and provided crews for a drillship offshore California.</p></li>
                        </ul>

                        <li><p>1959 – Global Marine obtained its first multi-well drilling contract. Its crews drilled the first subsea production wells, which were completed with subsea trees and flow lines to the shore from Texaco’s “Jade” lease in about 300 feet of water offshore Santa Barbara, California.</p></li>

                    <p>Oil and gas discoveries continued to drive growing demand for offshore drilling services during the 1960s, requiring extensive capital investments for new rigs and equipment.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><p>1960 - Santa Fe became a public company with shares sold through the OTC Market. It expanded drilling operations from the U.S. to Australia and the Pacific.</p></li><br>

                                <li><p>Glomar II (shown in photo) began operations as the first ship-shaped barge rig constructed as a newbuild unit. She was also the first self-propelled drillship to drill in Alaska's Cook Inlet and was later used in the Pacific in studies to evaluate mining of manganese nodules as part of the Deep Ocean Mining Project. The Cuss-class drillships names were changed this year from Cuss to Glomar.</p></li><br>
                                <li><p>Neptune Offshore was founded with capital from Forex and Languedocienne-Forenco.</p></li>

                                </p></li><br>
                                <li><p>The Offshore Company acquired International Drilling Co. Ltd. of London, marking the beginning of operations in the United Kingdom.</p></li>

                                <li><p>Mr. Cap, a LeTourneau jackup rig charted by Global Marine, became the first rig to drill offshore The Netherlands in the North Sea.</p></li><br>
                                <li><p>Global Marine placed the first public offerings of debenture and common stock as a Delaware company, providing it independence from Union Oil.</p></li>

                    <li><p>1965 - The Offshore Company’s Hustler entered service as the first movable cantilevered drilling rig on a jackup barge.</p></li><br>

                       <ul>
                        <li><p>Santa Fe was renamed Santa Fe International Corporation and purchased its first jackup rig.</p></li><br>
                        <li><p>The Glomar Challenger began collecting seabed sediment cores around the world, a role that extended into 1983. Data collected allowed major advances in the theories of plate tectonics and continental drift.</p></li><br>
                        <li><p>Schlumberger acquired a majority interest in Forex.</p></li>
